This site is designed to start a community of movie lovers.  Users will access the site to share what movies
they've recently viewed and enjoyed.  The site currently allows anyone to update the database.  There will
be future functionality put in to allow only logged in users to update their personal list and share their  
list.  If a user isn't logged in then the user can only view a master list.
